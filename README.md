5-6 hours

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?

This, and HW4, were particularly difficult for me. I think the instructions did a good job giving just enough infomration to guide you while still forcing you to figure things out on your own. I would suggest adding in something to remind the student that they will need to add the admin page url into csrf trusted origins and provide instructions for doing so.
